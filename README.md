# ColorChanger_AR

This Unity 3D project created with ARCore is a prototype for an ongoing research project. This project will result in an application that 
will enhance a devised theater performance by integrating AR into the performance. This specific prototype tints the screen a certain color
according to the emotion the user indicates. In the near future, the prototype's buttons will be "emoticons" or "faces" that portray the emotion
the user indicates.
