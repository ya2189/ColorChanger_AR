# ColorChanger_AR

This Unity 3D project created with ARCore is a prototype for an ongoing research project. This project will result in an application that 
will enhance a devised theater performance by integrating AR into the performance. This specific prototype tints the screen a certain color
according to the emotion the user indicates. The tint of the screen or camera displays how the user feels towards what they are viewing, and once multiple users indicate an emotion, the final color will show the general emotion of group. The "tint" of the camera is created by attaching a plane to the camera and changing the color of that plane. In the near future, the prototype's buttons will be "emoticons" or "faces" that portray the emotion the user indicates.
